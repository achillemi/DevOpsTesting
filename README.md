# API Testing in Continuous Integration for Reliability Assessment

This tool implements an automated API testing process that provides an accurate assessment of an application's reliability. The tool is currently built to work with [**Discourse**](https://discourse.org/) as an example application, but it can be extended to be used with any other application that offers its functionalities as web APIs.
